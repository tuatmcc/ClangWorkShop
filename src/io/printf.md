# printf

printfは画面に文字を表示するための関数です。

使用例：

```c
printf("Hello World");
```

<div class="warning">

This is a bad thing that you should pay attention to.

Warning blocks should be used sparingly in documentation, to avoid "warning
fatigue," where people are trained to ignore them because they usually don't
matter for what they're doing.

</div>
